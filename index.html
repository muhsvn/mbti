<p>===A Manifesto by Crood the Dood===<br /> <br /> A quick rundown on why you shouldn't take the MBTI seriously.<br /> <br /> ---What is Personality Psychology?---<br /> <br /> A branch of psychology concerned with understanding the similarities and differences between different individuals and their psychic processes.<br /> <br /> ---What is the point of Personality Psychology?---<br /> <br /> The purpose of any personality theory is to derive <strong>predictive and explanatory power. </strong>That is to say <strong>a personality theory is useless if it cannot both explain past actions and predict future ones.</strong></p>
<p>---What is the MBTI?---</p>
<p>MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, a theory based on a 1921 paper by Carl Jung titled "Psychological Types," the first major type theory.<br /> <br /> A type theory is more or less a personality theory that lumps people into groups based on supposed underlying psychological similarities. MBTI is a type theory that concerns itself with how people take in and process information, which means <strong>even if MBTI were hypothetically flawless, it is still a very limited theory which fails to account for many aspects of personality such as maturity, spirituality, moral outlook, manipulativeness, etc.</strong><br /> <br /> ---What does MBTI say about personality?---<br /> <br /> MBTI puts forth four dichotomies:<br /> <br /> Introversion/Extroversion (I/E)<br /> Intuition/Sensing (N/S)<br /> Thinking/Feeling (T/F)<br /> Judging/Perceiving (J/P)<br /> <br /> Of N/S/T/F your 'most dominant' function comes first, with each of the four functions taking an introverted or extraverted charge. For example, if I took an MBTI test these would be my results:<br /> <br /> INTJ<br /> <br /> Introverted Intuition<br /> Extraverted Thinking<br /> Introverted Feeling<br /> Extroverted Sensing<br /> <br /> Take note that the J/P preference is an indication of <strong>your first extraverted function, not your first function. </strong>In introverts the first extraverted function is the 2nd function, and the fact that almost no one knows this, but only their letters is proof enough that this theory is not worth considering. An INTJ is dominated by their perceptive function Introverted Intuition, the J represents the Extraverted Thinking that others see.<br /> <br /> I'm going to stop going into detail about function order here because quite frankly no one ever makes it this far. If you want to go google what each of these things mean, feel free to do so after you read the next section.<br /> <br /> ---Why is MBTI complete useless bullshit?---<br /> <br /> 1) Virtually no professional personality psychologists take the theory seriously. Its validity is more or less on par with a horoscope. <strong>If you need to read this quick rundown and think your opinion is more important than 95%+ of working personality psychologists, you are a fool.</strong><br /> <br /> 2) It fails replicability spectacularly. None of the tests consistently score people within the same type, much less can you come up with multiple different tests which reliably group people into the same type. <strong>This means it is not scientifically valid.</strong></p>
<p>3) The entire deviation from Jung's theory doesn't make any fucking sense. Introversion and Extraversion, for example, exist on a scale. You probably know some extreme introverts and extraverts, and a lot of people in the middle, right? <strong>There is no room in MBTI for subtelty. </strong>You're either an introvert or an extravert. If you think you're "60th percentile extraverted" then congratulations, the entire foundation of the theory is now broken beyond repair.<br /> <br /> 4) <strong>MBTI does not have explanatory or predictive power. </strong>No one can agree on how MBTI should be used in dating. No one can agree on how MBTI should be used in job selection, beyond very obvious observations. <strong>I know this because I took MBTI very seriously for 3~4 years, and read every available piece of information on the subject. There is virtually nothing MBTI can tell you about who you are or how to act in the world, which is the fucking point of personality psychology.</strong><br /> <br /> 5)<strong> The MBTI is vague to the point of uselessness</strong>. The statements MBTI make can often apply to almost everyone, which is why it's often compared to a horoscope.<br /> <br /> 6) The MBTI tests are universally awful.<br /> <br /> ---Why does anyone take the MBTI seriously then?---<br /> <br /> <strong>For exactly the same reason people take horoscopes seriously- the illusory promise of self knowledge in 15 minutes. </strong>That's fucking it. THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON.<br /> <br /> When someone reads a horoscope they can always find something that applies to themselves, and they tend to treasure the few observations that seem to fit, while discarding the ones that don't. This is precisely how the MBTI operates- there are vague personality profile clusters (No one actually understands the function order or any of the specifics of the theory) and people can always find one that kind of sounds like them. The problem is that these clusters don't necessarily educate you about yourself so much as distract you from actually useful theories that take time and effort to understand. You know, like any useful idea would.<br /> <br /> ---What theory isn't bullshit?---<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.jordanbpeterson.com/docs/230/2014/15DeYoung.pdf">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/DeYoung_2007_BFAS_JPSP.pdf</a><br /> <br /> ---What if I still want to debate you on MBTI?---<br /> <br /> Bare minimum read Gifts Differing, Psychological Types, and enough online resources to understand how the functions work as well as function order. I'll even include a TL;DR as an appendix, because I know you're too fucking lazy to actually do research or you'd already know all this shit.<br /> <br /> <strong>If you have not read Gifts Differing, Psychological Types, and other sources on function order your opinion is worse than useless.</strong><br /> <br /> Please fuck off with the MBTI, thank you. -crudefilmschool<br /> <br /> ================== Appendix 1: Advanced Myers-Briggs ==================</p>
<p>------------------------- Functional Behavior -------------------------</p>
<p>Behavior of Extraverted Sensors (Se): Lives in the present, hands on, show offs, experience-seeking, thinks on one's feet, outdoors</p>
<p>Behavior of Introverted Sensors (Si): Lives in the past, detail-oriented, security-seeking, follows rules, goes by the book, learning, recalling and comparing information</p>
<p>Behavior of Extraverted Intuitives (Ne): Creativity-driven, scatter-brained, tend to complicate ideas, interested in many ideas.</p>
<p>Behavior of Introverted Intuitives (Ni): Seeks and finds patterns, connects existing ideas, tends to simplify ideas, predicts the future, obsessively focused on one or two things.</p>
<p>Behavior of Extraverted Thinkers (Te): Thinks out loud, pragmatic, confrontational, needs objective proof, uses deductive logic</p>
<p>Behavior of Introverted Thinkers (Ti): Deep, contemplative thinking on a narrow range of topics, meditative, thinks internally, non-confrontational, inductive logic, organizing ideas, detatched</p>
<p>Behavior of Extraverted Feelers (Fe): Emotionally expressive, behaves in accordance with social norms, values harmony, sensitive to criticism, sense others emotions.</p>
